### medium term / backlog
- moar services
- better & responsive css
- form to request new tools, see status of other requests
    - maybe just copy gh issues to webapp 
- search for tools, view all tools in a list 
- show similar or reccomended tools 
- logins

### long term 
- paid tier
    - charge for expensive ops (large file conversion, video tools)
    - parallel jobs
        - thinking more like a general API than a webapp
    - easy way to repeat jobs
